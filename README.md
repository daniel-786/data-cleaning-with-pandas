# data-cleaning-with-pandas
The provided code snippet deals with analyzing a dataset about food choices, likely from a survey. It uses Python libraries like Pandas to explore the data.

First, the code reads a file named "food_coded.csv". This file presumably contains information about people's eating habits. We can see glimpses of the data using commands that show the first few rows or provide summary statistics.

The data likely includes details about demographics like gender and GPA, dietary habits like daily calorie intake and preferred diet, food preferences such as favorite cuisine and comfort food, physical activity levels, and other factors like income. There are both numerical data (like calories) and categorical data (like favorite cuisine).

This initial code helps us understand the structure of the data and identify any missing values. More advanced analysis can be done using Pandas and other tools. This could involve grouping data by factors like gender, finding relationships between different aspects of people's food choices, or creating visualizations to see trends more clearly.
